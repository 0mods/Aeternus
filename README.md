# AncientMagic

AncientMagic - a small magic mod that adds new leveling mechanics, items, and so on

# Mana

The mod will add a new kind of data, and liquid in general is mana. You can get it by generation, with the help of special items/blocks.

# Magic level

I want to note that the mod will add the mechanics of "character leveling", which will make the mod more difficult. The level will be obtained through various rituals. Also, I want to add that without a certain level, you will not be able to use this or that item or block until you reach it. For example: You have an item that requires the "Pre-High" level, and you have the "Medium" level - you will not be able to use this item until you reach the "Pre-High" level

# Compact
The mod is compatible with the following mods:
- Waystones
- Curios

## Waystones
The mod will complicate the game with Waystones by adding a requirement for teleportation, in the form of the presence of special dust or an item in the inventory. You can find out more about dust or the teleportation item in the game guidebook
## Curios
Add a new slot and make artifacts go there
## In plans
Over time, integration with the following mods will be added:
- [ ] Botania
- [ ] Occultism
- [ ] Mana and Artifice
- and etc.
